A file sharing alternative, built with web-torrent for small teams.

## Why a P2P drive?

`bit-drive` can be a good alternative to cloud file hosting. Your files are saved on the computers of you and your peers. Given the greater number of people with your file, the faster it will be to download. 
	Recently, I wanted to download an older version of `xcode`. This task took 18 hours to complete. After some thought, there is a bit of impracticality trying to ping a server 2000 miles away. 
	What if there were multiple servers, in different regions, all sharing a piece of the big file you're trying to download?  The download would be much faster. An 18 hour download also increases the possibility of a download failing. Torrents can be resumed/pause as they do not work like traditional downloads.
